defmodule Rachel.Games.RulesVerificationTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Comprehensive verification that the Rachel card game implementation
  correctly follows all the established rules.

  This test suite documents and verifies:
  1. Card dealing rules (7 for â‰¤6 players, 5 for 7-8 players)
  2. Special card effects and stacking
  3. Mandatory play rules  
  4. Deck exhaustion and reshuffling
  5. Game continuation until one player remains
  6. Turn order preservation after elimination
  7. Starting cards have no effects

  All tests in this file serve as both verification and documentation
  of the correct game rules implementation.
